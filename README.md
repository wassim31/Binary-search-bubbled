# Binary-search-bubbled
Implementation of two types of algorithms : searching algorithm ( binary search ) &amp; sorting algorithm ( bubble sort) 

1- Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Worst complexity: O(log n)
Average complexity: O(log n)
Best complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Data structure: Array
Class: Search algorithm

2- Bubble Sort: is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
